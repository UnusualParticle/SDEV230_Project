## Setuping up your environment

If you're using something other than VS, I'll assume you know what your doing. If you need additional assistance, contact UnusualParticle.

1. Open VS 2022 (that is the version I setup with, so we'll use that. It's free.)
2. Select "Clone a repository" under **Get Started**
3. Enter the location of this repo (https://github.com/UnusualParticle/SDEV230_Project.git)
4. Verify that it is being saved in a location you like
5. Click "Clone"

**Tada**You have a local copy of the repo

## Keep `main` Clean, Work in Your Branch!

+ Don't commit directly to main, unless editing a markdown file
  + Ideally just don't commit to main. We have other ways of keeping people up to date.
+ When you're updating something
  + Make branch
  + Make your changes in that branch
  + Commit to that branch
  + Merge the branch back up and delete the branch
+ Documentation!
  + Fill out your commit and pull comments
